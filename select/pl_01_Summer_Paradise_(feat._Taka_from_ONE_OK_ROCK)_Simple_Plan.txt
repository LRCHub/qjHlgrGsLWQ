O la da da dada
Yeah me and you in summer
paradise
My heart is sinking as I’m
lifted
Up above the clouds away from
you
And I can’t believe I’m
leaving
Oh I don’t know no no what I’m
gonna do
But, someday
I will find my way back to
To where your name is written in
the sand
Coz I remember every sunset
(I remember)
I remember every words you said
We would never gonna say good
bye (good bye)
Singing la da da da
Tell me how to get back to (back
to)
Back to summer paradise with you
And I’ll be there in a
heartbeat
I’ll be there I’ll be there
I’ll be there
I’ll be there in a heartbeat
And I’ll be there I’ll be
there I’ll be there
My soul is broken
Streets are frozen
I can’t stop this feelings
melting through
And I’d give away a thousand
days
Oh, just to have another one
with you (with you)
Where real life can wait
We’re crashing like waves
Playing in the sand (playing in
the sand)
Holding your hands
Coz I remember every sunset
(I remember)
I remember every words you said
We would never gonna say good
bye (good bye)
Singing la da da da
Tell me how to get back to (back
to)
Back to summer paradise with you
And I’ll be there in a
heartbeat
I’ll be there I’ll be there
I’ll be there
I’ll be there in a heartbeat
And I’ll be there I’ll be
there I’ll be there
My memories are reminding me
The perfect night on the perfect
beach
Ano hi no ki o kuwo kaki
atsumeta tokode
Modorisenai
The season not the reason why
I fell in love with you in
paradise
Kimi ga boku wo omoidasu tabi ni
And I’ll be there in a
heartbeat
Someday
I will find my way back to
To where your name is written in
the sand
Coz I remember every sunset
(I remember)
I remember every words you said
We would never gonna say good
bye (good bye)
Singing la da da dada
Tell me how to get back to (back
to)
Back to summer paradise with you
And I’ll be there in a
heartbeat
I remember when we first kissed
How I didn’t wanna leave your
lips
And how I’ve never ever felt so
high
Tell me how to get back to (back
to)
Back to summer paradise with you
And I’ll be there in a
heartbeat
I’ll be there I’ll be there
I’ll be there in a heartbeat...
